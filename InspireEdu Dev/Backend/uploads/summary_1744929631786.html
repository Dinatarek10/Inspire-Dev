\boxed{`<h2>Definition of Internet of Things (IoT)</h2>
<p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is an intermediate term used to refer to the interconnection of physical components with the ability to connect and exchange data, <b>without human interaction</b>, due to the integration of software and electronic components. The interconnection via the Internet of <b>computing devices embedded in everyday objects</b>, enabling them to send and receive data. The term IoT describes a network of objects in your home or office that have sensors and software that enables them to <b>communicate with each other</b> using the internet. <b>IoT is simply an extension of the internet into the physical world.</b></p>

<h2>Internet of Things (IIoT) Concept</h2>
<p>The Internet of Things (IIoT) is a concept that refers to <b>direct communication between devices</b> using any communications channel, including wired and wireless. The concept of the Internet IoT is the <b>physical object controller, sensor, and actuator.</b> The IoT Equation is the <b>Physical Object Controller, Sensor, and Actuator Equation.</b> Each physical system has a <b>digital simulation twin</b> that can simulate real-time sensor data that enters the physical system and generates recommendations to improve the performance of the system in real-time. Sensors can be real sensors or virtual sensors. Sens sensors can be either real sensors or virtual sensors.</p>

<h2>4S Rule for IoT Systems</h2>
<p>Any IoT system should satisfy the <b>4S rule: Simple, Secure, and Scalable (note that "4S" typically stands for "Simple, Secure, Smart, and Scalable," but the given text mentions "Simple, Secure, Smart, Scalable and Scalable," which seems like a typographical error where "Scalable" is mentioned twice and "Smart" seems to be a part of the 4S rule).</b></p>

<h2>Level-1 IoT System</h2>
<p>A level-1 IoT system is suitable for modeling <b>low-cost and low-complexity solutions</b> where the data involved is not big and the analysis requirements are <b>not computationally intensive.</b></p>

<h2>Level-2 IoT System</h2>
<p>The level-2 IoT system has a single node that performs sensing and/or actuation, stores data, performs analysis, and hosts the application. A Level-2 device and local analysis is a device that performs both <b>sensing and actuation and local analysis.</b> This is the ideal schematic. A lot of data that is pushed to the cloud is processed here first.</p>
<p>A level-2 IoT system is suitable for solutions where the <b>data involved is big</b>. However, the primary analysis requirement is not computationally intensive and can be done locally itself.</p>

<h2>Level-3 IoT System</h2>
<p>A level-3 IoT system has a single node. Data is stored in the cloud and the application is usually cloud-based. A level-3 IoT system is suitable for solutions where the data involved is <b>big</b>, and the analysis requirements are <b>computationally intensive.</b></p>

<h2>Level-4 IoT System</h2>
<p>Level-4 IoT systems are suitable for solutions where <b>multiple nodes</b> perform local analysis. Data is stored and analyzed in the cloud and the application is cloud based.</p>
<p>Level-4 IoT systems are suitable for solutions where multiple nodes are required, the data involved is <b>big</b>, and the analysis requirements are <b>not computationally intensive.</b></p>

<h2>Level-5 IoT System</h2>
<p>A level-5 IoT system has <b>multiple end nodes and one coordinator node.</b> The coordinator node is a level-4 system that contains local and cloud-based observer nodes which can subscribe to and receive information collected in the cloud from IoT devices.</p>
<p>Level-5 IoT systems are suitable for solutions based on wireless sensor networks where the data involved is <b>big</b> and the analysis requirements will be <b>computationally intensive.</b></p>

<h2>Level-6 IoT System</h2>
<p>A level-6 IoT system has <b>multiple independent end nodes</b> that perform sensing and/or actuation and send data to the cloud. Data is stored and analyzed in the cloud, and the application is cloud-based. The analytics component analyzes the data and stores the results in the database. The results are visualized with the cloud-based application. The centralized controller is aware of the status of all the end nodes and sends control commands.</p>`}
