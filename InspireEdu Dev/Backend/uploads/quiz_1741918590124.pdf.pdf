**3. Which characteristic is NOT typically associated with IoT devices? (Medium)**  
A. Minimal human intervention during operation.  
B. Long battery lifetime for most devices.  
C. Direct communication via explicitly defined links.  
D. Scalability and smart functionality.  
**Correct Answer:** C (IoT involves automatic communication without explicit links, unlike traditional networks.)

**4. What distinguishes Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication from IoT? (Medium)**  
A. M2M requires human interaction to function.  
B. M2M is a subset of IoT focused only on device-to-device communication via any channel.  
C. IoT excludes wireless protocols like ZigBee and Bluetooth.  
D. IoT devices cannot store data locally.  
**Correct Answer:** B (M2M refers to direct device communication, while IoT extends to broader internet integration and data sharing.)

**5. A company wants to deploy an IoT system for monitoring city-wide energy consumption. The system must handle large datasets and perform computationally intensive analysis. Which IoT level is most appropriate? (Hard)**  
A. Level-2 (Local analysis with cloud storage)  
B. Level-3 (Cloud analysis and applications)  
C. Level-5 (Coordinator node with computationally intensive tasks)  
D. Level-6 (Independent nodes with cloud communication)  
**Correct Answer:** B (Level-3 specifies cloud-based storage and analysis for computationally intensive tasks, fitting the scenario.)
