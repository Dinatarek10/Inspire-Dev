**5. How many times will the `input()` function execute if the user types `"right"` three times and then `"left"` in the Lost Forest example?**  
**(Hard)**  
```python  
n = input("You're in the Lost Forest. Go left or right? ")  
while n == "right":  
    n = input("You're in the Lost Forest. Go left or right? ")  
print("You got out!")  
```  
A) 1  
B) 3

D) 5  
**Answer:** C) 4

**Explanation for Q5:** The `input` runs once before the loop. The user enters `"right"` three times (triggering 3 more inputs inside the loop), then enters `"left"` on the fourth iteration, exiting the loop. Total inputs: 4.
