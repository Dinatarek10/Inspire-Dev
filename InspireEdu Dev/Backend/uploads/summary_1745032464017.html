<h1>Definition and Introduction to IoT</h1>
<p><b>Internet of Things (IoT)</b> is a term used to refer to the interconnection of physical components which have the ability to connect and exchange data without human interaction, due to the integration of software and electronic components. The interconnection via the Internet of computing devices embedded in everyday objects enables them to send and receive data. The term IoT describes a network of objects in your home or office that have sensors and software that enable them to communicate with each other using the internet. IoT is simply an extension of the internet into the physical world.</p>

<h1>Internet of Internet-of-Things (II)</h1>
<p>The <b>Internet Internet-of-Things (II)</b> is a concept that refers to direct communication between devices using any communications channel, including wired and wireless. The concept of the Internet IoT is the physical object controller, sensor, and actuator. The IoT Equation is the Physical Object Controller, Sensor, and Actuator Equation. Each physical system has a digital simulation twin that can simulate real-time sensor data that enters the physical system and generates recommendations to improve the performance of the system in real-time. Sensors can be real sensors or virtual sensors.</p>
<p>Sensors can be either real sensors or virtual sensors. Any IoT system should satisfy the 4S rule: <b>Simple, Secure, Smart, and Scalable (note: the text seems to mention "Scalable" twice in "4S rule: Simple, Secure, Smart, Scalable and Scalable," which is likely an error. Another "S" rule might be missing or duplicated).</b> A level-1 IoT system is suitable for modeling low-cost and low-complexity solutions where the data involved is not big and the analysis requirements are not computationally intensive.</p>

<!-- IoT System Levels -->
<h1>IoT System Levels</h1>

<h2>Level-1 IoT System</h2>
<p>A level-1 IoT system is suitable for modeling low-cost and low-complexity solutions where the data involved is not big and the analysis requirements are not computationally intensive. The level-2 IoT system has a single node that performs <b>sensing and/or actuation</b>, stores data, performs analysis, and hosts the application.</p>

<h2>Level-2 IoT System</h2>
<p>A Level-2 IoT system has a single node that performs sensing and/or actuation and local analysis. This is the ideal schematic. A lot of data that is pushed to the cloud is as follows: A single node that performs sensing and actuation, stores data locally, performs analysis, and hosts the application. This level is suitable for solutions where the data involved is big, but the primary analysis requirement is not computationally intensive and can be performed locally.</p>

<h2>Level-3 IoT System</h2>
<p>A level-3 IoT system has a single node where data is stored in the cloud and the application is usually cloud-based. However, it seems there might be an error here as it should be mentioned what the single node does specifically. Based on what seems like a more logical structure here, a level-3 IoT system is typically for solutions where the data involved is big and the data is stored in the cloud, making the system suitable for such scenarios where the analysis requirements are computationally intensive.</p>
<p>It seems there is a part missing from the given text where it mentions, "A level 3 IoT system is suitable for solution where the primary data is big, but the data is stored locally." However, this seems contradictory because the first part says that for a level-3 IoT system, data is stored in the cloud.</p>

<h2>Level-4 IoT System</h2>
<p>A level-4 IoT system has multiple nodes that perform local analysis. Data is stored and analyzed in the cloud and the application is cloud-based. Level-4 IoT systems are suitable for solutions where multiple nodes are required and the data involved is big, but the analysis requirements are not computationally intensive.</p>

<h2>Level-5 IoT System</h2>
<p>A level-5 IoT system has multiple end nodes and one coordinator node. The coordinator node is a level-4 system that contains local and cloud-based observer nodes which can subscribe to and receive information collected in the cloud from IoT devices. Level-5 IoT systems are suitable for solutions based on wireless sensor networks where the data involved is big and the analysis requirements are computationally intensive.</p>

<h2>Level-6 IoT System</h2>
<p>A level-6 IoT system has multiple independent end nodes that perform sensing and/or actuation and send data to the cloud. Data is stored and analyzed in the cloud and the application is cloud-based. The analytics component analyzes the data and stores the results in the database. The results are visualized with the cloud-based application. The centralized controller is aware of the status of all the end nodes and sends control commands.</p>
