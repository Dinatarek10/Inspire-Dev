<h2>Introduction to Internet of Things (IoT)</h2>
<p><b>Internet of Things (IoT)</b> is an intermediate term used to refer to the interconnection of physical components with the ability to connect and exchange data without human interaction, due to the integration of software and electronic components. The interconnection via the internet of computing devices embedded in everyday objects enables them to communicate with each other using the internet. The term IoT describes a network of objects in your home or office that have sensors and software that enables them to share data. They are usually traditional everyday objects such as vacuum cleaners, air conditioners and thermostats, TV sets, and refrigerators.</p>

<h2>Evolution of IoT</h2>
<p>The <b>IoT Equation</b> can be defined as: Physical Object + Controller, Sensor, and Actuator + Internet = Internet-of-Things. Concepts close to Ambient Intelligence are electronic environments that are sensitive and responsive to the presence of people. Machine-to-Machine concepts refer to direct communication between devices using any communications channel including wired and wireless.</p>

<h2>IoT Application Domains</h2>
<p><b>Digital Twins</b>: Each physical system has a digital simulation twin that can simulate real-time sensor data that enters into the physical system and generates recommendations to improve performance in real time.</p>

<h2>IoT Communication Protocols Stack</h2>
<p>Local processing is sometimes overlooked. This is the ideal schematic. A lot of data that is pushed to the cloud is irrelevant.</p>

<h2>IoT Enabling Technologies</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Wireless Sensor Network</li>
        <li>Cloud Computing</li>
        <li>Big Data Analytics</li>
        <li>Communication Protocol</li>
        <li>Embedded Systems</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>IoT Characteristics</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Minimal human intervention</b> during operation or configuration.</li>
        <li>Long battery lifetime, as most IoT devices are battery-operated devices.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>IoT 4s Rule</h2>
<p>Any IoT system should satisfy the <b>4s rule</b>: <b>Simple</b>, <b>Secure</b>, <b>Smart</b>, <b>Scalable</b>.</p>

<h2>IoT Challenges</h2>
<p>
    Specific challenges that IoT faces include:
    <ul>
        <li>Security and privacy concerns due to the interconnection of devices.</li>
        <li>Scalability issues when a large number of IoT devices require simultaneous connectivity.</li>
        <li>Energy efficiency and battery life for battery-operated devices.</li4
        <li>Complex data management and the need for big data analytics.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>IoT Levels and Deployment</h2>
<p>
    <b>Level-1 IoT systems</b> are suitable for solutions based on wireless sensor networks where the data involved is large but the analysis requirements are not computationally intensive. <b>Level-2 IoT systems</b> with independent nodes that directly communicate with the cloud are suitable for solutions that rely on wireless sensor networks. The centralized controller is aware of the status of all the end nodes and sends control commands to them. Results are visualized via cloud-based applications where the centralized controller is aware of the state of the system.
