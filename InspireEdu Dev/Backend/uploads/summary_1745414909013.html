    <h1>Introduction to IoT (Internet of Things)</h1>
    <p>
        <b>Internet of Things (IoT)</b> is an intermediate term used to refer to the interconnection of physical components with the ability to connect and exchange data without human interaction due to the integration of software and electronic components. The interconnection via the internet of computing devices embedded in everyday objects enables them to communicate with each other using the internet. The term IoT describes a network of objects in your home or office that have sensors and software that enables them to share data. These objects are usually traditional everyday objects such as vacuum cleaners, air conditioners, thermostats, TV sets, and refrigerators.

    <h2>Evolution of IoT</h2>
    <p>
        The IoT equation can be depicted as: <br>
        <b>Physical Object + Controller, Sensor, and Actuator + Internet = Internet-of-Things</b>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Concepts close to Ambient Intelligence are electronic environments that are sensitive and responsive to the presence of people. Machine-to-Machine concepts refer to direct communication between devices using any communications channel, including wired and wireless.
    </p>

    <h2>IoT Application Domains</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Digital Twins:</b> Each physical system has a digital simulation twin that can simulate real-time sensor data that enters the physical system and generates recommendations to improve performance in real time.
    </p>
    
    <h1>IoT Communication Protocols Stack</h1>
    <p>
        Local processing is sometimes overlooked. This is the ideal schematic. A lot of data that is pushed to the cloud is irrelevant.
    </p>

    <h2>IoT Enabling Technologies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Wireless Sensor Network</li>
        <li>Cloud Computing</li>
        <li>Big Data Analytics</li>
        <li>Communication Protocol</li>
        <li>Embedded Systems</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h1>IoT Characteristics</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Minimal human intervention during operation or configuration.</li>
        <li>Long battery lifetime, as most IoT devices are battery-operated devices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>IoT Rule</h2>
    <p>
        Any IoT system should satisfy the <b>4S rule</b>:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Simple</b></li>
            <li><b>Secure</b></li>
            <li><b>Smart</b></li>
            <li><b>Scalable</b></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <h1>IoT Challenges</h1>
    <p>
        (This part needs additional text details from the input context if any specific challenges were mentioned explicitly earlier in the text. At this point, the text only mentions “IoT Challenges” as a heading.)
    </p>

    <h2>IoT Levels & Deployment</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Level 1:</b> IoT systems that are suitable for solutions based on wireless sensor networks, in which the data involved is big and the analysis requirements are not computationally intensive.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Level 2:</b> Independent nodes with cloud communication are suitable for solutions relying on wireless sensor networks. The centralized controller is aware of the status of all the end nodes and sends control commands to the nodes. The results are visualized with the cloud-based application, and the centralized controller is aware of the state of the system.
