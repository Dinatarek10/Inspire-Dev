\boxed{<h2>Definition of Internet of Things (IoT)</h2>
<p>
    <b>Internet of Things (IoT)</b> is an intermediate term used to refer to the interconnection of physical components with the ability to connect and exchange data, without human interaction, due to the integration of software and electronic components. The interconnection via the Internet of computing devices embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to send and receive data. The term IoT describes a network of objects in your home or office that have sensors and software that enables them to communicate with each other using the Internet. IoT is simply an extension of the Internet into the physical world.

<h2>Internet Internet-of-Things (II) Concept</h2>
<p>
    The <b>Internet Internet-of-Things (II)</b> is a concept that refers to direct communication between devices using any communications channel, including wired and wireless. The concept of the Internet IoT is the physical object controller, sensor and actuator. The IoT Equation is the <b>Physical Object Controller, Sensor and Actuator Equation</b>. Each physical system has a digital simulation twin that can simulate real-time sensor data that enters the physical system and generates recommendations to improve the performance of the system in real time. Sensors can be real sensors or virtual sensors. (Note: The second part should probably be "Sensors can be real sensors or virtual sensors.")

<h2>4S Rule for IoT Systems</h2>
<p>
    Any <b>IoT system should satisfy the 4S rule</b>: <b>Simple, Secure, Smart, Scalable</b> (Note: The text mentions "Simple, Secure, Smart, Scalable and Scalable," so "Scalable" is repeated; however, "4S rule" should typically stand for four "S" terms, so it seems that "Scalable" is mentioned twice here. Either "Smart" or "Scalable" might be a mistake here. However, based on "4S rule" which stands for four attributes, "Smart" might be a valid part although it seems that "5 attributes" are listed here. The fifth "S" mentioned might be an error. Typically found in IoT context, the "4 S's" could be defined as: "Sensing", "Safety", "Security", "Subscription" or similar such as "Simple, Secure, Smart, Scalable".)

<h2>Level-1 IoT System</h2>
<p>
    A <b>level-1 IoT system</b> is suitable for modeling low-cost and low-complexity solutions where the data involved is not big and the analysis requirements are not computationally intensive.
</p>

<h2>Level-2 IoT System</h2>
<p>
    A <b>level-2 IoT system</b> has a single node that performs sensing and/or actuation, stores data, performs analysis, and hosts the application. A Level-2 device and Local Analysis is a device that performs both sensing and actuation and local analysis. This is the ideal schematic. A lot of data that is pushed to the cloud is (Note: the sentence seems to be incomplete here).
</p>
<p>
    Level-2 IoT systems are suitable for solutions where the data involved is big. However, the primary analysis requirement is not computationally intensive and can be done locally itself. 
</p>

<h2>Level-3 IoT System</h2>
<p>
    A <b>level-3 IoT system</b> has a single node. Data is stored in the cloud and the application is usually cloud based. A level 3 IoT system is suitable for a solution where the primary data is big, but the data is stored locally.
</p>
<p>
    Level-3 IoT systems are suitable for solutions where the data involved is big and the analysis requirements are computationally intensive. 
</p>

<h2>Level-4 IoT System</h2>
<p>
    A <b>level-4 IoT system</b> has multiple nodes that perform local analysis. Data is stored and analyzed in the cloud and the application is cloud based. 
</p>
<p>
    Level-4 IoT systems are suitable for solutions where multiple nodes are required, the data involved is big and the analysis requirements are not computationally intensive.
</p>

<h2>Level-5 IoT System</h2>
<p>
    A <b>level-5 IoT system</b> has multiple end nodes and one coordinator node. The coordinator node is a level-4 system that contains local and cloud-based observer nodes which can subscribe to and receive information collected in the cloud from IoT devices.
</p>
<p>
    Level-5 IoT systems are suitable for solutions based on wireless sensor networks in which the data involved is big and the analysis requirements are computationally intensive.
</p>

<h2>Level-6 IoT System</h2>
<p>
    A <b>level-6 IoT system</b> has multiple independent end nodes that perform sensing and/or actuation and send data to the cloud. Data is stored and analyzed in the cloud and the application is cloud-based. The analytics component analyzes the data and stores the results in the database. The results are visualized with the cloud-based application. The centralized controller is aware of the status of all the end nodes and sends control commands.
