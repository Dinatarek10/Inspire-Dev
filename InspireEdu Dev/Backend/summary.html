"<h2>Discrete-Time Fourier Series</h2>
<p><b>Discrete-Time Fourier Series</b> is a linear combination of complex exponentials with fundamental frequencies that are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency of the periodic sequence. The motivation for representing discrete-time signals through the Fourier series is identical in both continuous and discrete time. Complex exponentials are eigenfunctions of linear time-invariant systems and therefore the effect of an LTI system on each of these basic signals is simply a (complex) amplitude change. However, in the discrete-time case, the representation involves only a finite number of complex exponentials because of the periodicity of the exponential sequence.</p>
<h2>Duality between the Analysis and Synthesis Equations</h2>
<p>The <b>discrete-time Fourier transform</b> is a summation very similar in form to the synthesis equation and suggests a strong duality between the analysis and synthesis equations. Because the basic complex exponentials repeat periodically in frequency, two alternative interpretations arise for the behavior of the Fourier series coefficients. One interpretation is that there are only <b>N coefficients</b>, and the second is that the sequence representing its <b>Fourier Series coefficients</b> can run on indefinitely but repeats periodically. In order to retain a duality between the time and frequency domains for the discrete-time Fourier series, the discrete-time Fourier series coefficients for a discrete-time periodic square wave are obtained by using the analysis equation. This is because the synthesis equation is now an integral and the analysis equation is a summation. This represents one difference between the discrete and the continuous Fourier transforms.</p>
<h2>Periodicity in Fourier Series</h2>
<p>Another important difference is that the <b>fourier series</b> is always a periodic function of frequency. Consequently, it is completely defined by its behavior over a frequency range of <b>2&pi;</b>, in contrast to the continuous <b>Fourier transform</b> which extends over an infinite frequency range.</p>
<h2>Illustration of Discrete-Time Fourier Series Coefficients</h2>
<p><b>Discrete-Time Fourier Series</b> is illustrated as the Fourier series coefficients being samples of an envelope. As the period increases, the envelope remains the same, but the samples representing the Fourier series coefficients become more closely spaced.</p>
<h2>Fourier Representation for Periodic and Aperiodic Signals</h2>
<p>The Fourier series coefficients for discrete-time aperiodic signals are used to represent them as the limiting form of a periodic signal with the period increasing. These coefficients function as the period increases and are compared to the Fourier Series coefficients of the discrete-time aperiodic signal. A summary of the approach used to obtain a Fourier representation of discrete-time aperiodic signals is thus based on a periodic signal where the period is allowed to increase.</p>
<h2>Discrete-Time Fourier Transform for a Rectangular Pulse</h2>
<p>The <b>discrete-time Fourier transform</b> for a rectangular pulse is described in terms of the discrete-time Fourier series as the period approaches infinity. The upper limit in the summation in the second equation should be <i>n = (N/2) - 1</i>. The analytical and synthesis equations for the Fourier transform are presented in detail. The first equation is a Fourier transformation for an exponential sequence. The second equation is an analysis of the three-dimensional Fourier series. The Fourier series coefficients of a periodic signal are described in terms of the Fourier transform of one period.</p>
<h2>Fourier Transform as a Discrete-Time Fourier Series</h2>
<p>The Fourier transform is defined as a discrete-time Fourier Series that is equal to <i>1/N</i> times the Fourier transform samples of one period of the <b>periodic signal</b>. This means that the Fourier transformation can be used to determine the number of periods of the signal. In this lecture, the relationship between the Fourier transform and the Fourier transform for a given signal is discussed.</p>
<h2>MIT OpenCourseWare</h2>
<p>MIT OpenCourseWare is a free online learning resource for Signals and Systems. It provides an overview of the Fourier series coefficients of Fourier transforms of <i>x[n]</i> and <i>X[n]</i>. This information can be used as a learning resource in a variety of ways. The following are some of the most commonly used Fourier transform coefficients: for a periodic signal <i>x[n]</i> representing one period, Fourier series coefficients of <i>x[n]</i> are equal to <i>(1/N)</i> times samples of the Fourier transformation of one period of the signal <i>x[n]</i>.</p>"
